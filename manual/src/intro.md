# Introduction

This class will cover the ins and outs of integrating Rust into a Service-Oriented-Architecture. In this class, we'll go over:

* Building a REST service
    * Start with a minimal HTTP server.
    * Add state, immutable and mutable.
    * Add services with layers.
    * Nest multiple routers together.
    * Call other REST services.
    * Error Handling.
    * Utilizing Middleware.
    * Using Headers.
    * Additional Layer Services.
* Tracing
    * Logging
    * Timing with Spans
    * Timing Axum Requests from end-to-end
    * Logging targets: stdout, files, JSON
    * OpenTelemetry
* Documenting your REST API with OpenAPI
* Service Configuration
    * Environment Variables
    * Files
    * HTTP sources
    * The Command Line
