# Recap So Far

So far, you've learned to:

* Define your protocol in a protobuf file.
* Automatically turn the protobuf file into Rust.
* Write a server and client that use it.
* Stream data using channels across client-server boundaries.

Now for a word of warning: Tonic is quite new, and is developing fast. Using the more advanced features is a bit rough-and-ready while it catches up to Axum-like usability. 

Refer to [https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic/tree/master/examples) for *many* examples of what you can do with Tonic as it is.
