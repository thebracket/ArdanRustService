# Service Design

Designing a service architecture is a *big* topic (Bill teaches a great design philosophy oriented class, much of which is applicable to Rust).

There's several layers to service design:

* Designing Individual Services.
    * Module and Crate Structure.
    * Writing for Clarity.
    * Tailoring Your Design to Your Team.
    * Flexibility.
    * API stability.
* Service Architecture.
    * Monolith.
    * Modular Monolith.
    * Microservices.
    * Nanoservices.
    * Designing for YOUR need AND your cost structure.
* Maintainability.
* Observability.

This section is more philosophical and less code, but we'll look at some practical examples along the way.
